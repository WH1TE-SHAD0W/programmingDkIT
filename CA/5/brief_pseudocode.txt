Task:

Exercise 1)
Write a function that validates an email address. Your function should take in a single parameter – the string to be
validated as an email address – and should return True if the string is a legitimate email address and False
otherwise. A string is considered an email address if:
• It contains exactly one @. There must be at least one character before the @.
• It contains at least one . AFTER the @. There must be text before and after the .

Analysis:
    The string is indexable, so I can iterate that string. Using this function I will loop throughout to check the
    correctness. I will

Exercise 2)
Write a program that allows a user to write an email. Your program should prompt the user to enter the following:
• Subject
• Recipient (an email address. Your program should validate this using your function from exercise 1 and
should not proceed until a valid email has been entered)
• Message body
Once this information has been read in, your program should append them to the file for the specified recipient
(i.e. a file with the name matching the recipient’s email address). You should use an appropriate delimiter to
separate the information making up the email when writing it to the file.
Exercise 3)
Write a program that asks the user to enter their email address, then reads in the contents of their email file, i.e.
the file with a name matching their email address (generated in the previous exercise) into a list of tuples (each
email should be stored as a tuple). Your program should repeatedly offer the following menu:
• Sort the emails:
o By sender (ascending)
o By date received (descending)
o By subject (ascending)
• Display all emails
• Exit
Hint: You will need to make sure the structure this program uses to parse the emails out of the file matches the
structure used in the previous application.
