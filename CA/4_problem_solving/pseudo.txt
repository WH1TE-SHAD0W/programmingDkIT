The outcome is kinda program with user input to add or subtract money from a user's account.
Requirements:
    -   get user log in and sign in
    -   user input
    -   data storage and allocation of account to user
    -   ability to change the data based on the user input
    -   file to store all the data that is going to act as DB

make a table for users, columns : username, password, account_balance
its empty so to fill it up and continue from using the data from before were gonna load it from our file
open a file with all the  data and load it into list

make the user not logged in to start from such default state

do while we don't quit:
    if user is logged in:
        match statement to get what user want:
            in case it is withdrawal:
                ask how much, subtract it from account and get him the money
            in case it is deposit:
                ask how much, add it to account and get the money from him
            in case it is to check balance:
                tell him how poor he is
            in case he wants to log out:
                log out and say bye bye
            in case it is something else:
                tell hime wtf he wants, I have no idea...

    if user is not logged in:
        match statement if user wants to sign up or log in:
            in case he wants to log in:
                ask what is his username
                ask what is his password
                if it is correct:
                    log him in
                else:
                    say your credentials are wrong
            in case he wants to sign up:
                ask for username
                ask for password
                make a new row in table of users with username, password and account balance of 0
            in case we want to quit that program its kinda necessary to store our data outside the program as the variables
                are going to get erased
            in any other case:
                ask wtf he wants here



pseudo code for a code using classes / objects

every person is object with parameters of username, password and account balance
the program should just adjust those parameters of such objects or create them with default values
i am going to use the same logic of program but different style and usages of functions

class user
    definition of object parameters: __init__ (self, username, password, account_balance)

    define certain functions:
        withdrawal, it's going to check balance and if there is enough put out that amount of money
        deposit, take in money and increment the account balance
        balance, print out the account balance

any other functions:
    sign up, to create another object as user
        easily just add him to the list
    log in, check user input username and password if such instance exists otherwise not log in
    store data
        to get all parameters of objects stored outside of the program
    load data
